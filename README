A place to test things related to buildr

- The testmodule shows that the test/build does not fail even if
  there's a configuration error. Just run `buildr clean test' and
  see if the build is failing or if it's successful - for me the
  test is successful

- Test testmodule2 contains two tests Test1 and Test2, where Test2
  has a test method that fails. Though, a `buildr clean test' does
  finish successfully
